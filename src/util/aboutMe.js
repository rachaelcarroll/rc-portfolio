    paragraph1: "I'm a software developer who is passionate about all things user experience, interaction, and design. My goal as a developer is to leverage technology to build things that matter.",
    paragraph2: "I am a recent graduate of Turing School of Software and Design where I gained experience building reliable, thoroughly tested apps individually and on teams. I thrive in the balance of logic and fluidity of design and language that software engineering provides and I've grown by learning how others create and interpret code.",
    paragraph3: "I'm currently seeking a developer role in an inclusive environment that upholds authentic and empathetic practices and I am eager to work with others that align with these values. And when I'm not pushing up code, you can most likely find me outside with my schnauzer, searching for the best burrito in town, or geeking out on home design & vintage finds."
