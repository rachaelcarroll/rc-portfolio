    paragraph1: "I'm a software developer passionate about leveraging technology to create a seamless user experience through innovative and thoughtful user interface design and development.",
    paragraph2: "I graduated from Turing School of Software and Design where I studied front end web development and gained experience building reliable, thoroughly tested apps individually and on teams. I thrive in the balance of logic and fluidity of design and language that software engineering provides and I grow by learning how others create and interpret code.",
    paragraph3: "Prior to software development, I ran the marketing and operations of an all women commercial real estate team, worked countless hours in the restaurant industry, and helped grow my family's sip and paint studio into a thriving business. My goal is to bring my full self to an inclusive, authentic, and creative software development team where I can continue to learn and grow in this field. And when I'm not pushing up code, you can most likely find me with my schnauzer, Albus, listening to a Bren√© Brown podcast, or geeking out on home design & vintage finds."
